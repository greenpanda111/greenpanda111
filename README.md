## Hi ðŸ‘‹ I'm Ben

I'm an undergraduate electronic engineer studying at The university of York with a passion for biomedical engineering
<br>
I'm currently completing my final year at university, while also conducting independant research into soft robotics for automating medical processes as well as developing my own soft robotics kit to assist with teaching of soft robotics to undergraduates as well as use in research.
<br>
In my spare time, I like to work on designing custom mechanical keyboards in hopes of eventually building a complete board with a CNC'd aluminium case.
